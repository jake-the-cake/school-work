#Things to do

This application allows you to create, read, update, and delete items from a list using state management and rerending with React.

## Usage
- visit https://github.com/jake-the-cake/school-work/tree/main/week14/ToDo-List/revised
- add text to the field labelled "Add Todo..."
- press Enter to add
- Click anywhere on the item you would like to remove to remove it from the list

## Roadmap
- a new state variable needs to be created for completed tasks
